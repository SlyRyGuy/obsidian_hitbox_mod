# obsidian_hitbox_mod
Files for Qanba Obsidian to allow for a hitbox mod. 

DXF files for use for laser cutters on acrylic; 1/8th inch is the recommended acrylic thickness for the acrylic to be flush with the obsidian. 
SolidPart file is also available for anyone interested in modifying the layout of the panel, just remember that moving the buttons around to specific places will cause the buttons to have overlap with the plastic under the acrylic, and might require sanding down to make space for the buttons. 
Solidpart can also be converted to a 3D print file/STL, but I have not tested this so I dont have any specific recommendations for infill or otherwise. 
There is no metal plate needed to be placed under the acrylic, I am a heavy button masher but the plate has remained very sturdy after a few months of use. 

I hope you enjoy this, I was really annoyed there was no simple/cheap mod for turning the obsidian to a hitbox without having to pay for shipping from europe so I ended up making this quickly. It's worked well enough for me and I hope it works well enough for you guys as well :)
